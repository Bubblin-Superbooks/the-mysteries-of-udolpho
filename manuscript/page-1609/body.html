<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Shipwreck</h4><pre class="  ">’Til solemn midnight! On this lonely steep,  
Beneath this watch-tow’r’s desolated wall,  
Where mystic shapes the wonderer appall,  
I rest; and view below the desert deep,  
As through tempestuous clouds the moon’s cold light  
Gleams on the wave. Viewless, the winds of night  
With loud mysterious force the billows sweep,  
And sullen roar the surges, far below.  
In the still pauses of the gust I hear  
The voice of spirits, rising sweet and slow,  
And oft among the clouds their forms appear.  
But hark! what shriek of death comes in the gale,  
And in the distant ray what glimmering sail  
Bends to the storm?—Now sinks the note of fear!  
Ah! wretched mariners!—no more shall day  
Unclose his cheering eye to light ye on your way!</pre></div> </div>
