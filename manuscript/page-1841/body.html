Oh! then I deprecate your awful reign!  
The loud lament yet bear not on your breath!  
Bear not the crash of bark far on the main,  
Bear not the cry of men, who cry in vain,  
The crew’s dread chorus sinking into death!  
Oh! give not these, ye pow’rs! I ask alone,  
As rapt I climb these dark romantic steeps,  
The elemental war, the billow’s moan;  
I ask the still, sweet tear, that listening Fancy weeps!</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
