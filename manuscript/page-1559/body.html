His tender oaten reed I watch to hear,  
Stealing its sweetness o’er some plaining rill,  
Or soothing ocean’s wave, when storms are near,  
Or swelling in the breeze from distant hill!  

I wake the fairy elves, who shun the light;  
When, from their blossom’d beds, they slily peep,  
And spy my pale star, leading on the night,—  
Forth to their games and revelry they leap;  

Send all the prison’d sweets abroad in air,  
That with them slumber’d in the flow’ret’s cell;  
Then to the shores and moonlight brooks repair,  
Till the high larks their matin-carol swell.  

The wood-nymphs hail my airs and temper’d shade,  
With ditties soft and lightly sportive dance,
