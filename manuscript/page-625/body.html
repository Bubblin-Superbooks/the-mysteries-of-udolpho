And infants—at his very look had died!  

The moon’s cold beam athwart the temple fell,  
And to his sleeping prey the Tartar led;  
But soft!—a startled camel shook his bell,  
Then stretch’d his limbs, and rear’d his drowsy head.  

Hamet awoke! the poignard glitter’d high!  
Swift from his couch he sprung, and ’scap’d the blow;  
When from an unknown hand the arrows fly,  
That lay the ruffian, in his vengeance, low.  

He groan’d, he died! from forth a column’d gate  
A fearful shepherd, pale and silent, crept,  
Who, as he watch’d his folded flock star-late,  
Had mark’d the robber steal where Hamet slept.
