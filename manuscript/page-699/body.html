The lonely aspect of her room made Emily unwilling that Annette should leave her immediately, and the dampness of it chilled her with more than fear. She begged Caterina, the servant of the castle, to bring some wood and light a fire.</p><p>“Aye, lady, it’s many a year since a fire was lighted here,” said Caterina.</p><p>“You need not tell us that, good woman,” said Annette; “every room in the castle feels like a well.
