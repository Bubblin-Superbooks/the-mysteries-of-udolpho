And once the poet rais’d his deathless strain,  
O’er Ilion’s plains a weary driver led  
His stately camels: For the ruin’d fane  

Wide round the lonely scene his glance he threw,  
For now the red cloud faded in the west,  
And twilight o’er the silent landscape drew  
Her deep’ning veil; eastward his course he prest:  

There, on the grey horizon’s glimm’ring bound,  
Rose the proud columns of deserted Troy,  
And wandering shepherds now a shelter found  
Within those walls, where princes wont to joy.  

Beneath a lofty porch the driver pass’d,
