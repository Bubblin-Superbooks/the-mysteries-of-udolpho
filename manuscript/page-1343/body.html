The storm of midnight swells, the sails are furl’d,  
Deep sounds the lead, but finds no friendly shore,  
Fast o’er the waves the wretched bark is hurl’d,  
“O Ellen, Ellen! we must meet no more!”  

Lightnings, that show the vast and foamy deep,  
The rending thunders, as they onward roll,  
The loud, loud winds, that o’er the billows sweep—  
Shake the firm nerve, appall the bravest soul!  

Ah! what avails the seamen’s toiling care!  
The straining cordage bursts, the mast is riv’n;  
The sounds of terror groan along the air,  
Then sink afar;—the bark on rocks is driv’n!  

Fierce o’er the wreck the whelming waters pass’d,  
The helpless crew sunk in the roaring main!
