<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>To The Bat</h4><pre class="  ">From haunt of man, from day’s obtrusive glare,  
Thou shroud’st thee in the ruin’s ivy’d tow’r.  
Or in some shadowy glen’s romantic bow’r,  
Where wizard forms their mystic charms prepare,  
Where Horror lurks, and ever-boding Care!  
But, at the sweet and silent ev’ning hour,  
When clos’d in sleep is ev’ry languid flow’r,  
Thou lov’st to sport upon the twilight air,  
Mocking the eye, that would thy course pursue,  
In many a wanton-round, elastic, gay,  
Thou flit’st athwart the pensive wand’rer’s way,  
As his lone footsteps print the mountain-dew.  
From Indian isles thou com’st, with Summer’s car,  
Twilight thy love—thy guide her beaming star!</pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">To a warm imagination, the dubious forms, that float, half veiled in darkness, afford a higher delight,</p></div> </div>
