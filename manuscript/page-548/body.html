<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To some soft shell that warbles near;  
Join’d by the murmuring currents, fleet,  
That glide along our halls so clear.  

There, the pale pearl and sapphire blue,  
And ruby red, and em’rald green,  
Dart from the domes a changing hue,  
And sparry columns deck the scene.  

When the dark storm scowls o’er the deep,  
And long, long peals of thunder sound,  
On some high cliff my watch I keep  
O’er all the restless seas around:  

Till on the ridgy wave afar  
Comes the lone vessel, labouring slow,  
Spreading the white foam in the air,  
With sail and top-mast bending low.
