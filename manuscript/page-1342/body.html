As gradual glides the bark along the flood;  
His bride is seen no more—“Adieu!—adieu!”  

The breeze of Eve moans low, her smile is o’er,  
Dim steals her twilight down the crimson’d west,  
He climbs the top-most mast, to seek once more  
The far-seen coast, where all his wishes rest.  

He views its dark line on the distant sky,  
And Fancy leads him to his little home,  
He sees his weeping love, he hears her sigh,  
He sooths her griefs, and tells of joys to come.  

Eve yields to night, the breeze to wintry gales,  
In one vast shade the seas and shores repose;  
He turns his aching eyes,—his spirit fails,  
The chill tear falls;—sad to the deck he goes!
