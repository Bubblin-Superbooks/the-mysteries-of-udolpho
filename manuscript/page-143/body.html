The moon was rising, but her light was yet too feeble to assist them. While they stepped carefully on, they heard the vesper-bell of a convent. The twilight would not permit them to distinguish anything like a building, but the sounds seemed to come from some woods, that overhung an acclivity to the right. Valancourt proposed to go in search of this convent. “If they will not accommodate us with a night’s lodging,” said he, “they may certainly inform us how far we are from Montigny, and direct us towards it.” He was bounding forward, without waiting St. Aubert’s reply, when the latter stopped him. “I am very weary,” said St. Aubert, “and wish for nothing so much as for immediate rest. We will all go to the convent; your good looks would defeat our purpose; but when they see mine and Emily’s exhausted countenances, they will scarcely deny us repose.”
