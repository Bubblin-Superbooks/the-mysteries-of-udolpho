THE SEA-NYMPH  

Down, down a thousand fathom deep,  
Among the sounding seas I go;  
Play round the foot of ev’ry steep  
Whose cliffs above the ocean grow.  

There, within their secret cares,  
I hear the mighty rivers roar;  
And guide their streams through Neptune’s waves  
To bless the green earth’s inmost shore:  

And bid the freshen’d waters glide,  
For fern-crown’d nymphs of lake, or brook,  
</pre></div> </div>
