<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">court,<br>That hangs its head o’er winding rill.</p><p>But these I’ll leave to be thy guide,<br>And show thee, where the jasmine spreads<br>Her snowy leaf, where may-flow’rs hide,<br>And rose-buds rear their peeping heads.</p><p>With me the mountain’s summit scale,<br>And taste the wild-thyme’s honied bloom,<br>Whose fragrance, floating on the gale,<br>Oft leads me to the cedar’s gloom.</p><p>Yet, yet, no sound comes in the breeze!  
What shade thus dares to tempt thy stay?<br>Once, me alone thou wish’d to please,<br>And with me only thou wouldst stray.</p><p>But, while thy long delay I mourn,<br>And chide the sweet shades for their guile,<br>Thou may’st be true, and they forlorn,<br>And fairy favours court thy smile.</p></div> </div>
