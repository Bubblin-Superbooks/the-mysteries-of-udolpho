<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Where sweet fruits bloom, and fresh spring roves,  
And closing boughs the tempest brave.  

Then, from the air spirits obey  
My potent voice they love so well,  
And, on the clouds, paint visions gay,  
While strains more sweet at distance swell.  

And thus the lonely hours I cheat,  
Soothing the ship-wreck’d sailor’s heart,  
Till from the waves the storms retreat,  
And o’er the east the day-beams dart.  

Neptune for this oft binds me fast  
To rocks below, with coral chain,  
Till all the tempest’s over-past,  
And drowning seamen cry in vain.
