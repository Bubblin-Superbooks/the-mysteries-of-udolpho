<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">He fear’d his own, and sav’d a stranger’s life!  
Poor Hamet clasp’d him to his grateful heart;  
Then, rous’d his camels for the dusty strife,  
And, with the shepherd, hasten’d to depart.  

And now, aurora breathes her fresh’ning gale,  
And faintly trembles on the eastern cloud;  
And now, the sun, from under twilight’s veil,  
Looks gaily forth, and melts her airy shroud.  

Wide o’er the level plains, his slanting beams  
Dart their long lines on Ilion’s tower’d site;  
The distant Hellespont with morning gleams,  
And old Scamander winds his waves in light.  

All merry sound the camel bells, so gay,  
And merry beats fond Hamet’s heart, for he,  
E’er the dim evening steals upon the day,
