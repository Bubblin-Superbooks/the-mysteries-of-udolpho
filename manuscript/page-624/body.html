For Time’s imperious voice was frequent heard  
Shaking the marble temple to its fall,  
(By hands he long had conquer’d, vainly rear’d),  
And distant ruins answer’d to his call.  

While Hamet slept, his camels round him lay,  
Beneath him, all his store of wealth was piled;  
And here, his cruse and empty wallet lay,  
And there, the flute that chear’d him in the wild.  

The robber Tartar on his slumber stole,  
For o’er the waste, at eve, he watch’d his train;  
Ah! who his thirst of plunder shall control?  
Who calls on him for mercy—calls in vain!  

A poison’d poignard in his belt he wore,  
A crescent sword depended at his side,
