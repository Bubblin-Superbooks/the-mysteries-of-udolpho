<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Lead me through all thy sacred haunt;  
The minister’s moonlight aisles along,  
Where spectres raise the midnight chaunt.  

I hear their dirges faintly swell!  
Then, sink at once in silence drear,  
While, from the pillar’d cloister’s cell,  
Dimly their gliding forms appear!  

Lead where the pine-woods wave on high,  
Whose pathless sod is darkly seen,  
As the cold moon, with trembling eye,  
Darts her long beams the leaves between.  

Lead to the mountain’s dusky head,  
Where, far below, in shade profound,  
Wide forests, plains and hamlets spread,  
And sad the chimes of vesper sound,  
</pre></div> </div>
