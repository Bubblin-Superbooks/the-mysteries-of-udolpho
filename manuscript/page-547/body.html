<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">My song is hush’d, my wonders end!  

Within the mountain’s woody bay,  
Where the tall bark at anchor rides,  
At twilight hour, with tritons gay,  
I dance upon the lapsing tides:  

And with my sister-nymphs I sport,  
Till the broad sun looks o’er the floods;  
Then, swift we seek our crystal court,  
Deep in the wave, ’mid Neptune’s woods.  

In cool arcades and glassy halls  
We pass the sultry hours of noon,  
Beyond wherever sunbeam falls,  
Weaving sea-flowers in gay festoon.  

The while we chant our ditties sweet  
</pre></div> </div>
