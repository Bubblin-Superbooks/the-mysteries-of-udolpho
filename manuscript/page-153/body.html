<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of yon starred concave climbs the full-orbed moon,  
And to this nether world in solemn stillness,  
Gives sign, that, to the list’ning ear of Heaven  
Religion’s voice should plead? The very babe  
Knows this, and, chance awak’d, his little hands  
Lifts to the gods, and on his innocent couch  
Calls down a blessing.
