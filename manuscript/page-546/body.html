<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And when deep sleep the crew has bound,  
And the sad lover musing leans  
O’er the ship’s side, I breathe around  
Such strains as speak no mortal means!  

O’er the dim waves his searching eye  
Sees but the vessel’s lengthen’d shade;  
Above—the moon and azure sky;  
Entranc’d he hears, and half afraid!  

Sometimes, a single note I swell,  
That, softly sweet, at distance dies;  
Then wake the magic of my shell,  
And choral voices round me rise!  

The trembling youth, charm’d by my strain,  
Calls up the crew, who, silent, bend  
O’er the high deck, but list in vain;
