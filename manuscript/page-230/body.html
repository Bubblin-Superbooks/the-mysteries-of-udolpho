#### THE FIRST HOUR OF MORNING</pre><p>How sweet to wind the forest’s tangled shade,<br>    When early twilight, from the eastern bound,<br>Dawns on the sleeping landscape in the glade,<br>    And fades as morning spreads her blush around!</p><p>When ev’ry infant flower, that wept in night,<br>    Lifts its chill head soft glowing with a tear,<br>Expands its tender blossom to the light,<br>    And gives its incense to the genial air.</p><p>How fresh the breeze that wafts the rich perfume,<br>    And swells the melody of waking birds;<br>The hum of bees, beneath the verdant gloom,<br>    And woodman’s song, and low of distant herds!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Then, doubtful gleams the mountain’s hoary head,<br>    Seen through the parting foliage from afar;<br>And, farther still, the ocean’s misty</p></div> </div>
