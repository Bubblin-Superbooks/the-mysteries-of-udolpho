<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">As, weary, to the nether world he goes,  
And mountain-summits catch the purple gleam,  
And slumbering ocean faint and fainter glows,  

Silent upon the globe’s broad shade I steal,  
And o’er its dry turf shed the cooling dews,  
And ev’ry fever’d herb and flow’ret heal,  
And all their fragrance on the air diffuse.  

Where’er I move, a tranquil pleasure reigns;  
O’er all the scene the dusky tints I send,  
That forests wild and mountains, stretching plains  
And peopled towns, in soft confusion blend.  

Wide o’er the world I waft the fresh’ning wind,  
Low breathing through the woods and twilight vale,  
In whispers soft, that woo the pensive mind  
Of him, who loves my lonely steps to hail.
