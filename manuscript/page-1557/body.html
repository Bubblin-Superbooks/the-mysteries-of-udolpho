I move along the realms of twilight air,  
And hear, remote, the choral song decay  
Of sister-nymphs, who dance around his car.  

Then, as I follow through the azure void,  
His partial splendour from my straining eye  
Sinks in the depth of space; my only guide  
His faint ray dawning on the farthest sky;  

Save that sweet, lingering strain of gayer Hours,  
Whose close my voice prolongs in dying notes,  
While mortals on the green earth own its pow’rs,  
As downward on the evening gale it floats.  

When fades along the West the Sun’s last beam,
