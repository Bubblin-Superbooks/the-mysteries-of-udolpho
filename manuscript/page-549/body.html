Then, plunge I ’mid the ocean’s roar,  
My way by quiv’ring lightnings shown,  
To guide the bark to peaceful shore,  
And hush the sailor’s fearful groan.  

And if too late I reach its side  
To save it from the ’whelming surge,  
I call my dolphins o’er the tide,  
To bear the crew where isles emerge.  

Their mournful spirits soon I cheer,  
While round the desert coast I go,  
With warbled songs they faintly hear,  
Oft as the stormy gust sinks low.  

My music leads to lofty groves,  
That wild upon the sea-bank wave;
