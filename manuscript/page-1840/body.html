<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>To The Winds</h4><pre class="  ">Viewless, through heaven’s vast vault your course ye steer,  
Unknown from whence ye come, or whither go!  
Mysterious pow’rs! I hear ye murmur low,  
Till swells your loud gust on my startled ear,  
And, awful! seems to say—some God is near!  
I love to list your midnight voices float  
In the dread storm, that o’er the ocean rolls,  
And, while their charm the angry wave controls,  
Mix with its sullen roar, and sink remote.  
Then, rising in the pause, a sweeter note,  
The dirge of spirits, who your deeds bewail,  
A sweeter note oft swells while sleeps the gale!  
But soon, ye sightless pow’rs! your rest is o’er,  
Solemn and slow, ye rise upon the air,  
Speak in the shrouds, and bid the sea-boy fear,  
</pre></div> </div>
