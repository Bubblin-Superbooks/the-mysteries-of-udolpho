<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">When the yellow beams slope, and sparkle thro’ the glade,  
And swiftly in the thin air the light swallows soar!  

But sweeter, sweeter still, when the sun sinks to rest,  
And twilight comes on, with the fairies so gay  
Tripping through the forest-walk, where flow’rs, unprest,  
Bow not their tall heads beneath their frolic play.  

To music’s softest sounds they dance away the hour,  
Till moonlight steals down among the trembling leaves,  
And checquers all the ground, and guides them to the bow’r,  
The long haunted bow’r, where the nightingale grieves.  

Then no more they dance, till her sad song is done,  
But, silent as the night, to her mourning attend;
