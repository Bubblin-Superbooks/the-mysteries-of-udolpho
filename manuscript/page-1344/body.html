“Farewell, my love!—we ne’er shall meet again!”  

Oft, at the calm and silent evening hour,  
When summer-breezes linger on the wave,  
A melancholy voice is heard to pour  
Its lonely sweetness o’er poor Henry’s grave!  

And oft, at midnight, airy strains are heard  
Around the grove, where Ellen’s form is laid;  
Nor is the dirge by village-maidens fear’d,  
For lovers’ spirits guard the holy shade!</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
