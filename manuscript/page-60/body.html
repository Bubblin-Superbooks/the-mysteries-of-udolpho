<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">That yester-eve I lighted them, along the dewy green,  
To seek the purple flow’r, whose juice from all her spells can free.  

And now, to punish me, she keeps afar her jocund band,  
With the merry, merry pipe, and the tabor, and the lute;  
If I creep near yonder oak she will wave her fairy wand,  
And to me the dance will cease, and the music all be mute.  

O! had I but that purple flow’r whose leaves her charms can foil,  
And knew like fays to draw the juice, and throw it on the wind,  
I’d be her slave no longer, nor the traveller beguile,  
And help all faithful lovers, nor fear the fairy kind!
