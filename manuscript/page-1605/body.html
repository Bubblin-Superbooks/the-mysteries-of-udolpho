Thou hast no figures, nor no fantasies,  
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;  
Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.  
                    SHAKESPEARE</pre><p>The Count, who had slept little during the night, rose early, and, anxious to speak with Ludovico, went to the north apartment; but, the outer door having been fastened, on the preceding night, he was obliged to knock loudly for admittance. Neither the knocking, nor his voice was heard; but, considering the distance of this door from the bedroom, and that Ludovico, wearied with watching, had probably fallen into a deep sleep, the Count was not surprised on receiving no answer, and, leaving the door, he went down to walk in his grounds.</p></div> </div>
