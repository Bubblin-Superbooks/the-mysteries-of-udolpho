Partook with them the simple, cool repast,  
And in short vesper gave himself to God.  

From distant lands with merchandise he came,  
His all of wealth his patient servants bore;  
Oft deep-drawn sighs his anxious wish proclaim  
To reach, again, his happy cottage door;  

For there, his wife, his little children, dwell;  
Their smiles shall pay the toil of many an hour:  
Ev’n now warm tears to expectation swell,  
As fancy o’er his mind extends her pow’r.  

A death-like stillness reign’d, where once the song,  
The song of heroes, wak’d the midnight air,  
Save, when a solemn murmur roll’d along,  
That seem’d to say—“for future worlds prepare.”
