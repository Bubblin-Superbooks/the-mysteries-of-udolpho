<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">out,  
While, in strange-looking shapes, they frisk about the ground,  
And, afar in the woods, they raise a dismal shout,  
Till I shrink into my cell again for terror of the sound!  

But, see where all the tiny elves come dancing in a ring,  
With the merry, merry pipe, and the tabor, and the horn,  
And the timbrel so clear, and the lute with dulcet string;  
Then round about the oak they go till peeping of the morn.  

Down yonder glade two lovers steal, to shun the fairy-queen,  
Who frowns upon their plighted vows, and jealous is of me,  
</pre></div> </div>
