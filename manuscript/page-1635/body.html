I will not take upon me to pronounce, that the late Marquis was criminal, or to say what was the crime of which he was suspected; but, concerning the punishment our daughter Agnes hinted, I know of none he suffered. She probably alluded to the severe one, which an exasperated conscience can inflict. Beware, my children, of incurring so terrible a punishment—it is the purgatory of this life!

Our holy convent received her mortal part; her heavenly spirit, I doubt not, ascended to its sanctuary!”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As the abbess spoke this, the last bell of vespers</p></div> </div>
