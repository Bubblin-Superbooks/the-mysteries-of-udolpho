<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Through winding woods and pastures wide,  
And many a wild, romantic nook.  

For this the nymphs, at fall of eave,  
Oft dance upon the flow’ry banks,  
And sing my name, and garlands weave  
To bear beneath the wave their thanks.  

In coral bow’rs I love to lie,  
And hear the surges roll above,  
And through the waters view on high  
The proud ships sail, and gay clouds move.  

And oft at midnight’s stillest hour,  
When summer seas the vessel lave,  
I love to prove my charmful pow’r  
While floating on the moonlight wave.
