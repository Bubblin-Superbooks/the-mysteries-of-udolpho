#### SONNET</pre><p>Now the bat circles on the breeze of eve,<br>    That creeps, in shudd’ring fits, along the wave,<br>    And trembles ’mid the woods, and through the cave<br>Whose lonely sighs the wanderer deceive;</p><p>For oft, when melancholy charms his mind,<br>    He thinks the Spirit of the rock he hears,<br>    Nor listens, but with sweetly-thrilling fears,<br>To the low, mystic murmurs of the wind!</p><p>Now the bat circles, and the twilight-dew<br>    Falls silent round, and, o’er the mountain-cliff,<br>    The gleaming wave, and far-discover’d skiff,<br>Spreads the grey veil of soft, harmonious hue.</p></div> </div>
