<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Or guide me, where the dashing oar  
Just breaks the stillness of the vale,  
As slow it tracks the winding shore,  
To meet the ocean’s distant sail:  

To pebbly banks, that Neptune laves,  
With measur’d surges, loud and deep,  
Where the dark cliff bends o’er the waves,  
And wild the winds of autumn sweep.  

There pause at midnight’s spectred hour,  
And list the long-resounding gale;  
And catch the fleeting moonlight’s pow’r,  
O’er foaming seas and distant sail.</pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The soft tranquillity of the scene below, where the evening breeze scarcely curled the water, or swelled the passing sail, that caught the last gleam of the sun, and where, now and then, a dipping oar was all that</p></div> </div>
